Project Title: LLM-Based Travel Review Sentiment & Intent Classification
“Built an LLM-driven text classification system using prompt engineering to analyse customer travel reviews into sentiment and intent categories.”
Use Case:Modern businesses need to analyse customer feedback to improve service quality — and this system automates that with LLMs.
Key Features: Uses GPT-based LLM with prompt engineering
Two-level classification: sentiment + intent
Context-aware prompting for higher accuracy
Evaluation on real-world review datasets
Modular Python code for reproducibility
Python
HuggingFace Transformers
OpenAI API / LLM APIs
Pandas, Scikit-learn
Matplotlib / Seaborn
Project Architecture
Dataset → Preprocessing → LLM prompts → Predictions → Evaluation
Results:
✓ Confusion matrix
✓ Accuracy/F1 scores
✓ Example of correct & incorrect predictions
✓ How prompt engineering improved outcomes
How to Run the Project: Simple step-by-step instructions for cloning the repo and running scripts.
Future Work
Show ambition and planning:
Add fine-tuning
Add multilingual support
Add a small web UI (Streamlit)
Deploy model API
